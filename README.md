# discord-signup-bot

This is a bot that handles event signups for discord servers.
It was written for use in Elder Scrolls Online communities, but could
easily be used for other games and communities as well.

See [this website](https://www.evogames.org/bots/eso-signup-bot/) for some documentation
on using the bot.

## TODO

- working REPL (need to mock guild state to force admin)
- dealing with long messages (2000 char limit?)
- update documentation
- more context cancellation follow-through
